# Uber Rides Java SDK (beta)

Official Java SDK (beta) to support the Uber Rides API.

## Before you begin

This is a beta Java SDK not intended to be run on Android. An official Android SDK will be released soon.

## Running the sample

First, add your client ID and secret retrieved from developer.uber.com to `src/main/resources/secrets.properties`.

To run the servlet sample, run `$ ./gradlew clean :samples:servlet-sample:build :samples:servlet-sample:run`. You may
need to add the redirect URL (http://localhost:8181/Callback) to your application (at developer.uber.com)
for OAuth2 to succeed.

For full documentation, visit our [Developer Site](https://developer.uber.com/v1/endpoints/).
